# eXtra Ores

My first (and a fun little one!) modification I have made for Minecraft on the Fabric mod loader! Adds new ores, items and their respective tools and armour sets to play around with.

![Demo Voidium](https://github.com/junyali/extra-ores/blob/master/preview/demo_voidium.png?raw=true "Voidium Demo")

## Features

- Luminitite Ore, found in the overworld with glowing properties (WIP)
- Infernium Ore, found in the nether with fiery properties (WIP)
- Voidium Ore, found in the end (WIP)

## To do

- Add recipes (I don't know why but they don't work :( )
- Add more functionality, balance stats of tools and armours
- Convert block and item registries to DataGens (tried this once and gave up after like 3 hours due to lack of documentation)

## How to run / build

### Requirements
